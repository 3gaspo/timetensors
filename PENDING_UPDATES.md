- 2026-08-11: Serialize automatic publishers with a repository `flock` across
  add, commit, proxy authentication, and push; make the Slurm publisher fail
  immediately after any command error. Update the publisher contract test,
  README, and experiment guideline. Focused checks passed: Bash syntax,
  `src/tests/test_publisher_contract.py`, and `src/tests/test_slurm_workflow.py`.
  Deferred coverage: a live pair of concurrent cluster publishers. No
  experiment rerun is required.
